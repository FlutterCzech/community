# Czech & Slovak Flutter Community

Our focus is to connect front-end developers and other roles interested in cross-platform app development using Flutter SDK.

Our goal is to support the communication about Flutter SDK through a series of meetups, talks, and workshops. We talk and discuss Flutter, cross-platform app development, design systems, pattern libraries, UI kits, tools, etc.

Flutter is a mobile app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android, from a single codebase.

We have the support [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/JZg7T7C) for our community, feel free to join us. You can find tips on Flutter-related events, tools - but mostly - community open to help with any challenges you are solving in your journey to better collaboration.
